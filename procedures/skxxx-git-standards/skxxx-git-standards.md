# SKXXX - How to Write a Great Git Commit Message
## Purpose - Collaborate with the team and future selves through descriptive messages
## Policy - 

## 1. Separate subject from body
```bash
$ man git commit
```
> Though not required, itâ€™s a good idea to begin the commit message with a single
short (less than 50 character) line summarizing the change, followed by a blank line
and then a more thorough description. The text up to the first blank line in a
commit message is treated as the commit title, and that title is used throughout
Git.

There will be times where a straightforward change will not require both a subject and a body.  For example:

```
Commit Message: Change user login icons
```

In the above example, a `single short (less than 50 character) line summarized the change`. If the reader needs additional information on the change, commands such as `git show`, `git diff`, or `git log -p` can be used.

A one-lined subject can be committed with:

```bash
$ git commit -m "Change user login icons"
```

However, there may be commits that benefit from a more detailed explanation.

```
Update passwords to SHA-512

Utilized the python crypt library to generate a SHA-512 hashed
password from clear text. This encryption algorithm is salted for
additional security.
```

There are two methods to creating a git commit message with a subject and a body.

1. 

```bash
$ git commit
```
```
{Should be in the git commit text editor screen; start appending text}
Update passwords to SHA-512

Utilized the python crypt library to generate a SHA-512 hashed
password from clear text. This encryption algorithm is salted for
additional security.
```

2. 

```bash
$ git commit -m "Update passwords to SHA-512" \
> -m "Utilized the python crypt library to generate a SHA-512 hashed
> password from clear text. This encryption algorithm is salted for
> additional security
```

The `git commit` option is more elegant, as it opens up your default text editor.

## 2. Limit subject line to 50 characters
As stated in the previous rule, a concise 50-character summary of the change is a rule of thumb, not a hard limit. If there is difficulty in coming up with a concise summary, it could mean that there are too many changes going on at once. If this is the case, split up the commits into multiple commits. Github will truncate any subject line greater than 69 characters, so consider the subject line to be between 50-69 characters.

## 3. Capitalize the subject line
```
Update passwords to SHA-512 <-- Correct
```
```
update passwords to SHA-512 <-- Incorrect
```

## 4. Do not end the subject line with a period
Consider the subject line to be the title of your commit message. Title's do not have periods.
```
Update the passwords to SHA-512 <-- Correct
```
```
Update the passwords to SHA-512. <-- Incorrect
```

## 5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
_Imperative mood_ - Giving a command or instruction

* Change the lightbulb
* Create a mess
* Delete the paragraph
* Update passwords to SHA-512

The subject lines above are all in the **present tense**, so commits like the following would be incorrect:

* Fixed bug that prevented payments
* Testing user login credentials
* Just changed the index page

**A commit subject line should be able to complete the following sentence:**

If applied, this commit will _subject line_

If applied, this commit will _Update passwords to SHA-512_.

The imperative mood is only necessary for the subject line, so the body does not have to follow this rule.

## 6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
Git does not automatically wrap text at 72 characters, so this will be at your own discretion. Text editors such as VI/VIM will show the number of characters per line. This will allow Git to perform proper indentation while keeping everything under 80 characters overall.

## 7. Use the body to explain what and why versus how
For the most part, you can omit details about how a change has been made. This should be self-explanatory in the code or source comments. The important part here is to focus on the following:

1. Behavior of the code before the change, and what was wrong with the behavior previously
2. Behavior of the code after the change
3. Why you decided to solve it the way you did
